SoCal R User Group is hosting a data science hackathon on the weekend of April 22-23 at UC Irvine. We would like to invite you to be a mentor. As a mentor, you will work one-on-one with the teams, and provide guidance. You are not expected to solve their problems. Instead, we encourage you to guide them to find the solutions themselves.

What type of guidance do the teams need? Based on your past experience, teams do need technical assistance but most of the guidance is related to how they should approach the data. In the early stages of the event, this often means helping them decide what questions to address, or how to do an exploratory data analysis. Later on, groups often need help with statistical analysis or building models. On Sunday they are putting together their presentations and need here there.

The hours for the mentors are Saturday from 1:00 PM - 10:00 PM on Saturday, April 22 and 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM on Sunday, April 23. We are asking for a 2-3 hour time commitment (more if you want).
